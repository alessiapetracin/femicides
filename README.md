# Feminicides by Italian and non-Italian citizens: a comparison #

On Italian news and in the politcal discourse, we oftentime hear about the nationality of those people who commit feminicides. This generates the perception that most feminicides occur at the hand of non-Italian citizens, who often become the target of attacks from right-wing politicians on the matter. The following study aims at researching whether an actual difference is present in the number of feminicides commited by Italians and non-Italians citizens, namely Eastern Europeans, North-Africans and Asians, the three groups which represent the majority of people with a foreign nationality on the Italian soil.

### Data ###
To conduct the study, we employ the following sources:
- https://www.tuttitalia.it/statistiche/cittadini-stranieri-2016/
- https://www.istat.it/it/files/2018/04/Analisi-delle-sentenze-di-Femminicidio-Ministero-di-Giustizia.pdf
- https://www.istat.it/en/files/2017/06/Italy_in_figures_16.pdf
- the dataset which can be found in the same Github section

in order to estimate the number of people with non-Italian nationality, the total population and the number of rapes in the years 2012-2016.

### Methods ###
To answer the research hypothesis, we conduct two types of tests:
- A chi-square test, to test whether the differences are strong enough to provide evidence that the authors of feminicides are not a random sample of the general population.
  In this case: the null-hypothesis (H0) assumes that the authors of feminicides represent a random sample from the general population, whether the alternative hypothesis (H1) postulates that the authors of feminicides are not a random sample from the general population.

- A hypothesis test, comparing the feminicide rate between Italians and foreigners. In this case, H0 represents the assumption that the nationality of people who commit feminicides is a random sample from the general population, whereas H1 assumes that the nationality of people who commit feminicides is not a random sample from the general population (which would imply that some nationalities are over-represented and others are under-represented in the people found guilty of committing feminicides.

### Findings ###
Both tests suggest that there is strong evidence against the null-hypothesis, namely, some nationalities are over-represented in the actual count of feminicides authors. In particular, it appears that Italians tend to commit less feminicides than other nationalities, thus the sample of the authors of feminicides is not representative of the general population. In fact, non-Italian citizens are more than three times more likely to commit a feminicide than Italian citizens.

### Limitations ###
The present analysis is particularly limited by the poor data available on the matter. We believe that further data collection is needed at an institutional level, in order to conduct an analysis more suitable to the current composition of the Italian population and the more recent statistics on feminicides.

### Further research ###
We believe that further research on the matter would benefit the political landscape, providing verified data to the political discourse. Furthermore, a more attentive data collection on the matter, which would include socio-cultural and economic factors, could aid policy-makers to operate on such a delicate matter, in order to actually understand which factors lead to feminicides and whether acting upon them could decrease the phenomenon. Seen the nationalities of people who are more likely to commit a feminicide, it is only natural to wonder whether economic or linguistic indicators impact the phenomenon, and whether policy-makers could pursue actions able to reduce the phenomenon.
